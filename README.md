# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Jupyter Notebook.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all code, plots, and observations.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## 📊 What This Project Covers

1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Mean, median, standard deviation
   - Missing value analysis

2. **Visualizations**
   - Histograms for numeric features
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Pairplot for feature relationships

3. **Trends and Patterns**
   - Age distribution
   - Fare distribution (raw and log-scaled)
   - Survival distribution by class and family members

4. **Observations**
   - Most passengers were aged 20–35.
   - Fare is skewed with high outliers.
   - Many passengers traveled alone.
   - 'Survived' and 'Pclass' show interesting patterns for prediction.

## 📌 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells step by step.
